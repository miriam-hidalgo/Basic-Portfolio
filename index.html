            <p>My name is Miriam Hidalgo. I was originally born in the Dominican Republic and was brought to the US when I was 7 months old. I grew up in West New York, NJ. I went to school there all my life until I went to Rutgers University in New Brunswick. There I majored in Psychology and double minored in Sociology & Criminology.</p>

            <p>I used to work at a computer lab in college and it has been my favorite job. Being around computers and performing hardware & software troubleshooting for students was very enjoyable for me. I always wanted to enter the tech world but was held back thinking it was a man's world & there is no place for me, a woman of color. Now, with learning how there are so many coding bootcamps and getting into this Rutgers Coding Bootcamp I feel the confidence to pursue what I thought was once reserved only for males.</p>
